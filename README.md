# Indesicion App 😕❓💻

This project has been created with the purpose of applying the fundamentals of Vue that have been acquired in the Fernando Herrera course. My first experience practicing and implementing this great Vue Framework.

A fun application where all your doubts are left to the decision of a simple computer 🤭

## Instructions for use

You will need to enter the question in the field, followed by the question mark "❓" to make the computer think of the answer.

Simple, but it can make you smile!
